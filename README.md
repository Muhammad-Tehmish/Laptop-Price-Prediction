## Laptop Price Prediction

This project predicts the prices of laptops using machine learning regression models. It involves data exploration, feature engineering (including combining SSD and HDD sizes into total storage), visualization, data preparation (handling categorical variables and ensuring no missing values), model selection (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor), training, evaluation (using metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE), cross-validation, and new prediction. The project showcases how regression techniques can be applied to predict laptop prices based on various features such as brand, processor details, storage capacity, and more.
